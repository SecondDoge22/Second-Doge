# Second-Doge
Second Doge is a novel AI rebase and reward token on BSC.
The artificial intelligence (AI) of the token undergoes a series of analysis, calculates the most reasonable increase, and passively awards holders $DOGE.With a rebase token, the projects supply is variable and will adjust automatically on a routine basis. The design of rebases makes tokens more tradable and extremely profitable due to increased buying pressure.Holders earn a higher proportion of $DOGE rewards the earlier they purchase and the longer they hold. The development team were inspired to create Second Doge based on the original Doge.
